# Temporal Super-Resolution


### Purpose 
The goal of this task was to perform video frame interpolation. While the original dataset's images had 6 hours of separation, we investigate how we can use deep learning to super-resolve images on the time axis and gain a clearer picture of how weather patterns change on smaller timescales.

### Notebooks

`baseline_interpolation`: Generate bilinear interpolation baseline. 

`superslomo`: Run Super SloMo on custom dataset (need to specify fps per custom project). 

`similarity_score`: Compute SSIM, PSNR, and VGG loss for image pairs.
