The University of Michigan team repository for ProjectX 2020, a research competition focused on the use of machine learning in climate modeling. 

## Problem
Our project is entitled "The Devil is in the Details: A 

## Dataset
We used a subset of the [ExtremeWeather dataset](https://extremeweatherdataset.github.io/), consisting of images produced from the CAM5 (Community Atmospheric Model v5) climate simulation. We also used the [NCEP dataset](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html), consisting of climate maps generated by a combination of real-world observations and numerical weather prediction model output from 1948 to present. 

The exact subset of ExtremeWeather can be found at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13J8klWz6rRl6uUCpGzGl8nAl1wrOWH7-?usp=sharing).
