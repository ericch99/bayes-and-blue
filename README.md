University of Michigan team repository for ProjectX 2020, a research competition focused on the use of machine learning in climate modeling. 

## Dataset
We used the [ExtremeWeather dataset](https://extremeweatherdataset.github.io/), consisting of images produced from the CAM5 (Community Atmospheric Model v5) climate simulation. We also used the [NCEP dataset] (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html) consisting of climate maps generated by a combination of real-world observations and numerical weather prediction model output from 1948 to present.
